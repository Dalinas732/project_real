Analyzing Temperature Variability in Lansing, Michigan

Project Title and Brief Description Analyzing Temperature Variability in Lansing, Michigan: Standard Deviation and Climate Change Trends

This project aims to analyze the standard deviation of daily temperatures in Lansing, Michigan, across multiple time frames to investigate potential changes due to climate change. Using historical temperature data, we will quantify trends in variability and compute additional statistical measures such as mean, percentiles, and temperature extremes. The study will provide insights into how temperature fluctuations have evolved over decades.

Project Objectives:

Collect and preprocess historical temperature data for Lansing, MI.

Calculate the standard deviation of temperatures for each calendar day of the year.

Compare standard deviation trends across different time periods (e.g., 1950-1979, 1980-2009, 2010-present) to assess climate change impacts.

Compute additional statistical measures such as mean, percentiles, and variance.

Visualize temperature trends and variability using data visualization techniques.

Summarize findings in a final report with clear interpretations and implications.
